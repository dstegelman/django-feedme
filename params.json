{"name":"Django-feedme","tagline":"Google Reader replacement app in Python/Django","body":"Django Feed Me\r\n==============\r\n\r\nDjango Feed Me is a replacement for Google Reader.  It keeps track of your feeds, fetches the RSS feeds\r\nand parses them in an easy to read interface.  This is currently in development.  The app works as POC using the Django\r\nAdmin.  A seperate interface for adding feeds is coming down in the pipeline.\r\n\r\n![image](http://cl.ly/image/0j2z0y0K1e2e/Screen%20Shot%202013-04-27%20at%209.54.10%20AM.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo install FeedMe simply:\r\n\r\n    pip install django-feedme\r\n\r\nAdd ``feedme`` to your installed apps.  Add route a url to ``feedme.urls``\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Celery for fetching (Recommended) then add:\r\n\r\n    FEED_UPDATE_CELERY = True\r\n\r\nto your settings file.\r\n\r\nThis app bundles static and works out of the box with django static files.  If you aren't collecting static\r\nyou'll need to copy the static directory to where ever you serve static from.\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nPlease place all bug reports in Github Issues.  Pull requests are welcome and encouraged!!\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDocs are coming soon on RTD.  For now please refer to this file and the Wiki/Issues in this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Planned Features\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n* Import feeds from Google Reader\r\n* Add and manage feeds from the front end (rather than Django Admin)\r\n* Mark all or some feeds as read/unread\r\n* Look and Feel updates\r\n* Tests","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
