Django Feed Me
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dstegelman/django-feedme.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dstegelman/django-feedme)
[![Pypi Version](https://pypip.in/v/django-feedme/badge.png)](https://crate.io/packages/django-feedme/)


Django Feed Me is a replacement for Google Reader.  It keeps track of your feeds, fetches the RSS feeds
and parses them in an easy to read interface.  This is currently in development.  The app works as POC using the Django
Admin.  A separate interface for adding feeds is coming down in the pipeline.
